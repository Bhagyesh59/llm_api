The summary follows the YAML schema that follows pydantic class 'ConversationSummary'. Here is the Chat conversation :\\n\\nHere’s a sample conversation between a recruiter and a candidate:\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nHi, thanks for taking the time to chat today. Can you start by telling me a bit about your background?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nSure! I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and around 5 years of experience as a software engineer. I’ve worked mostly in backend development using Python and Java, and I’ve been involved in some cloud-based projects using AWS.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nThat’s great! Are you looking to continue working in backend development, or are you open to other areas as well?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nI’m definitely open to exploring other areas, but I really enjoy backend development. I’ve recently started learning more about DevOps and cloud infrastructure, so I wouldn’t mind working on something that involves both.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nThat’s interesting! We actually have a few roles that might fit your background, including one that focuses on backend work but also involves setting up cloud infrastructure. Would you be open to discussing that?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nYes, absolutely! I’d love to hear more about that position.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nIt’s with a mid-sized company that’s focused on e-commerce. They’re looking for someone to help build and maintain scalable backend systems while also managing their cloud setup on AWS. Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nThat sounds really good. I’ve worked with AWS in my previous role, so I’m familiar with setting up cloud environments and managing services like EC2, RDS, and S3.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nPerfect! I’ll go ahead and share your resume with the hiring manager. Do you have any specific salary expectations at this point?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nI’m looking for something in the range of $120,000 to $130,000, depending on the overall benefits and responsibilities.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nThat’s helpful to know. I’ll make a note of that. Do you have any other questions for me about the role or the company?\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nNot right now, but I’d be interested in learning more about the company culture and what the typical career progression looks like.\\n\\n**Recruiter:**  \\nI can definitely provide more details on that during the next steps. Thank you so much for your time today! I’ll be in touch soon.\\n\\n**Candidate:**  \\nThank you! Looking forward to it.\\n\\n[IMPORTANT]: You always return these summaries in a structured format and provide clear, focused information.
